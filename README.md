## Interactive Visualisation of Animal Sensor Data

An interactive visualisation that implements JOGL to examine various channels of cormorant data, including derived acceleration data, emphasising on the inherent simplicity of line-plots combined with *focus & context* elements of visualisation. Users can use a keyboard or mouse to explore the raw data set by moving through various sections and zooming in to focus on particular data points.
